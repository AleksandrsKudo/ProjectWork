# List-App

ABOUT:
Our app is designed to remind people of item locations by mainly using pictures.
The app stores a list of pictures of your uploaded items as well as their location and a small description of the item itself.
The app can be used both online and offline.
The difference between both of the options is that using the online option you’re able to save your lists to the cloud.
